/*! \mainpage BlockEditor
 *
 * This app allows you to create block schemes, save and load them and do a calculation using them.
 * It is very easy to learn, and great fun to use!
 *
 * \section Controls
 *
 * \subsection Blocks
 * After you start the application, you will see a neat menu on the left side and a play ground on the right side.
 * Use the menu to choose from eleven different blocks by left-clicking the block icon and then left-clicking
 * the free space. Each block type performs a different operation displayed by an intuitive icon.
 * Remember to place your blocks further from each other due to anti-collision detection. Blocks cannot
 * be too close to each other. In order to delete blocks just simply right-click them and they will disappear
 * together with all wires connected to them.
 *
 * \subsection Wires
 * Each block (apart from input blocks, about them later) requires either one or two input wires and allows
 * you to connect one output wire. The whole playground is situated left-to-right, the inputs are the ones on the
 * left of the box. In order to place a wire, choose "wire" in the menu and then left-click
 * two connectors of two different blocks. Wires can only connect output connectors with input ones and
 * do not allow you to use one connector multiple times. If any action violates these rules, nothing will happen.
 * Wires can be deleted, as well as blocks, by right-clicking them or removing any adjacent block.
 *
 * \subsection Inputs
 * To be able to compute anything, input blocks are required. Choose "input" option in menu and left-click
 * empty space. Beware collisions with other blocks. After placing an input block, a dialog window will pop up
 * asking you to enter value and type of the input block. This value will be sent through a connected wire to a
 * normal block. To remove input blocks, right-click them. The value of input blocks can be changed by double-clicking
 * the block and entering updated value. All buttons in menu must be unchecked during this process!
 *
 * \subsection Computation
 * There is not any output block. Every block or wire will tell you its value and type when you hover the cursor
 * over it. Use this method to get the final value of the last block or any other. Wires will automatically display
 * value in the middle (N means not defined value). Do not try to add wire to output connector of the last block.
 *
 * To perform computation choose "run" option from top bar and then "compute". This will compute everything. If you desire
 * to enjoy the computation step by step press "run" -> "debug" option and use your spacebar to move forward. To interrupt
 * debugging press escape. Progress of the debugging will be highlighted with red color.
 *
 * \subsection Saving
 * Your work can be saved by choosing "file" -> "save" and entering file name and later loaded by pressing
 * "file" -> "open". The "new" option resets the play ground and discards all unsaved work.
 *
 * Our program also allows you to enter your own custom types (apart from default "general" type). Press "types"
 * -> "add type"/"remove type" to do that.
